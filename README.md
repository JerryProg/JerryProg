- 👋 Hi!, My name is Jerry and I'm electric and electronic engineer. I want to keep learning Python and other prog languages for IoT applications.

- 👀  I'm interested in projects with Python as main programming language. This account contains projects with Python (web, desktop and embedded systems).
 
- 💞️ I will be creating, updating projects with many applications with Python. I'm open to any questions that you have. 

- **The main issue in this account is: the main idiom will be in _Spanish_.**
